The main goal of Hex is to create a universe with rich and dynamic prodecural content, along with strong competitive and cooperative gameplay, to support an economy of player-owned items.

This is a map of the tiles and spells in Hex. Soon players will be able to find, create, or purchase from other players, spells based on combinations of these symbols that have various effects.  Each generation of spells will introduce 256 new effects available to find and use.

Hex incorporates a full ecosystem of Ethereum tokens.  Hex, an erc-20 token, is the base currency in the universe.  Hex will be minted with a finite supply in each universe.  New universes mint new Hex to be found in each world, and represent new seasons in the competitive timeline. 

Hex items are erc-721 tokens and come in different categories.  Pets have a lifecycle and have a supply that inflates with birth rate and deflates with death rate. However, another resource can be consumed at the end of a pets lifecycle to bring them back to the egg stage, so overall the supply will inflate.  Weapons have a deflating but increasing in power supply, as old weapons are broken down to create higher tier items.

The Hex economy will be rich and as valuable as the game is fun to play.  We are currently in the development phase for the spells, and once they are done the combat gameplay update will be released.
